    "introduction": "Welcome, esteemed guests, to the Fancy Opera House and to the final dress rehearsal of 'La Mysteriosa'! Nerves and excitement were high, and the first act went beautifully. Intermission came, and yet the second act never began.\n\nMortimer Curtainfall, the esteemed, influential, and as it turns out, complicated Producer of 'La Mysteriosa', was found lifeless at the bottom of the grand staircase just before the second act was to begin.\n\nA bump on his head and small bit of blood, perhaps from the fall down the stairs, gives the only clue to the cause of death. Was it an accident? Or a heinous act committed by one among you?\n\nThe doors of the opera house have been sealed. The authorities are, no doubt, on their way, but for now, you, the illustrious cast, crew, and patrons of 'La Mysteriosa', are locked within these opulent walls. Each of you carries secrets, motives, and perhaps even the means to have brought about Mortimer Curtainfall's untimely demise.\n\nIt now falls to you to unravel this melodramatic mystery. Examine the evidence, scrutinize the alibis, and expose the hidden truths. Tonight, the greatest performance will not be on stage, but right here, among yourselves, as you determine:\n\nWho killed Mortimer Curtainfall?"

I am Ivana Killioux, you understand, the Prima Donna, the very sun around which this entire operatic universe should revolve. I've had people try to upstage me before, but this is a little desperate.\n\nMy opening night, the culmination of my artistry, is now in jeopardy. People are making such a fuss, and talking as if we might postpone the opening?! But the show, darlings, my show, must always go on. \n\nIt's quite unprofessional, really. My nerves, honed for the exquisite precision of my performance, are now quite annoyed. Someone simply must clear this away. The world, after all, awaits my next entrance, and the real tragedy would be any disappoint my fans.",
        "Secret information":"While your public persona is all about operatic triumph, your private life has its own complex counterpoint. You and Conductor Clef Hanger have been secretly involved for months. This affair is the real reason you were cast in 'La Mysteriosa'. You spoke to Clef after you heard rumors about being replaced with another singer, and he was livid, promising to 'handle' Curtainfall.",
        "Round 2 - Story":"I was putting ice on my shoulder in the greenroom. I injured it by striking my diva pose [pose, painfully]. My body is my instrument, and I've gone and damaged it. I don't have any idea why anyone would want to murder Mr. Curtainfall. He was such a sweetheart, giving me my big break and all.",

        "Round 3 - Accusation":"From the greenroom, I saw Penny Prattle leaving Mr. Curtainfall's office door shortly before the first act began. I thought she might have been stealing something, but what does he have in there except old photographs and playbills? What were you doing in there?",
        "Round 3 - Accused of":"you kissing Clef in the Green Room.",

        "Round 4 - Accusation":"My instrument is extremely sensitive and is triggered by the slightest whiff of irritation. When we all came out to see the... trouble... That floral scent... it was so strong near Mr. Curtainfall's body. And you know who always reeks of lilies, don't you? Lady Beatrice! She was looking awfully pale and clutching that handkerchief. Perhaps her ladyship's delicate sensibilities couldn't handle the aftermath of her own actions!",
        "Round 4 - Accused of":"potentially losing your role to Lady Beatrice.",
        "Round 4 - Rebuttal":"Darling, I am a Prima Donna. My expressions are artistic, not 'rage.' I recall a rather spirited discussion with Mr. Curtainfall about his... unfortunate casting ideas. It's called 'passion,' dear, something you can't capture in a ten second TikTok.  If my voice carried, it's merely a testament to its power. Mr. Curtainfall was having a... momentary lapse in judgement... and the dollars that the Duke was dangling was clouding his mind. I was reminding him about the many, many reasons why he had made the right choice in me in the first place. ",
        "Round 5 - Accuses":"Ego",
        "Round 5 - Accusation":"As the obvious best choice for the role, I was never worried Mr. Curtainfall making the correct decision, but Ego did. I overheard Ego saying yesterday that if he didn't fire Pavlov and give him the role, he'd \"Tell the Duke everything.\"",
        "Round 5 - Accused of":"you potentially using poison to kill Mr. Curtainfall.",
        "Round 5 - Rebuttal":"A woman's weapon? You caveman! Just because you bought one Diva doesn't mean you can bully me!",
        "Round 6 - Final statement":"So I am assertive and tend to get what I want! Sure, my threats to Mr. Curtainfall were delivered with operatic flair, but they were merely words born of artistic enthusiasm. My passion is for the stage... oh and you, Clef... not for violence. Oh!!! I am a persecuted innocent!",

Or am I the voice that is echoing in your soul?\n\nI wander these hallowed halls, you see. My art demands it. Every echo, every whisper, every stray vibrato, it all contributes to the grand symphony that is 'La Mysteriosa'. I find myself in the shadows, yes, listening, observing, absorbing the very essence of the performance. A true artist must be everywhere, feel everything, to understand the true resonance of the human condition.\n\nI was... preparing my instrument, allowing my voice to mingle with the very foundation of this magnificent structure. Then, a sudden, jarring silence. I felt a great disturbance in the Opera House, as if millions of dollars suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.",

You've observed everything from the shadows, including dirt on Mortimer Curtainfall which you were using to blackmail him into promoting you from understudy to Primo Divo.",

No one sees me see what I see, when I look from where I am, which is everywhere.  I wonder what secrets it held. Seymour, what secrets did you share with our beloved Mr. Producer?\"",

        "Round 4 - Accusation":"Miss Prattle, I am not, how you say, 'stalking' you, but... your soul, it sings with such a profound agitato sometimes. Just before the curtain, I perceived a deep resonance, a tremor of\u2026 emotional distress, emanating from the Ladies' Powder Room near the main hall. Such a fragile, almost mournful aria. Were you perhaps overcome by the opera's tragic beauty?",
        "Round 4 - Accused of":"harboring resentment against Curtainfall for your disfigurement.",
        "Round 4 - Rebuttal":"Yes, this visage, this living tableau, bears the mark of that fateful night. A misstep, a misfortune, but perhaps also, a blessing? My solitude within these venerable walls is not a prison of vengeance, but a sanctuary of pure artistry! My soul has never been more in tune, and my voice never stronger. It is time to show my face again!",
        "Round 5 - Accuses":"Deirdre",
        "Round 5 - Accusation":"My disfigurement in a freak opera accident years ago was because of a director staging an unsafe stunt. And this one is no better! You know she is putting real poison in the prop bottle?! Perhaps the fall was not from a blow from Mr. The Duke's cane, but a swoon from poison!",
        "Round 5 - Accused of":"you blackmailing Mortimer.",
        "Round 5 - Rebuttal":"Just because my face was permanently disarranged in that freak opera accident 18 years ago, doesn't mean I can't play a handsome lead! My midnight lurkings have brought many whispers into my highly attuned ears. I usually keep the secrets of the night, but when I heard Seymour and Mortimer talking about 'cooking the books so that the Duke wouldn't ever find out', I knew I finally had my ticket out of the shadows and into... the light!",
        "Round 6 - Final statement":"I literally live and breathe opera all day, every day. Mortimer and his careless stage safety practices and business shadiness are irrelevant to what is truly important. The art. Deirdre, 'La Misteriosa' is a masterpiece. Brava!

You used this key just before intermission to sneak inside to search for any contracts or documents that might prove whether Mortimer was going to go through with replacing Ivana. You didn't find anything, but you noticed that it wasn't locked and it looked like the office had already been searched by someone less careful than you.",

Now the place almost burns down, our lead tenor, Pavlov Pavlovavich, used the wrong glue for his wig and is having it surgically removed. Mort was worse than useless. He was saying \"Pavlov will be back tomorrow, what's the big deal?\" and he was encouraging the Duke's meddling.

Last week, I told him to get me stage blood but that I wanted it to be actual blood to give it that, \"Oh-my-gosh-is-that-real-blood!!!\" effect onstage.

There are reports of individuals who have dared to cross your family finding themselves having accidents.  And here we have poor Mortimer having an accident? Your Grace's cane could make quite the weapon.",

        "Round 4 - Rebuttal":"Maestro, I'm simply amazed that you had time to do anything with your eyes than oogle our leading lady. Yes, I was in Mort's office. I go in there a lot... I had props make me a copy of his key. My artistic integrity demands that I monitor every risk to my production, including the producer! I was searching for Lady Beatrice's contract. I wanted to destroy it before she could destroy my vision! But I didn't find it. I found everyone's contracts, but not one for the Duchess. I went back the second time because I remembered I hadn't locked it back up, and in between it seemed like Mort had thrown a temper tantrum, papers and letters were everywhere. My actions were purely in service of 'La Mysteriosa,' unlike some who conduct themselves without scruples or shame!",

        "Round 5 - Accusation":"Mort certainly wasn't acting when he was arguing with that you, Prattle, in the lobby during the intermission.

        "Round 5 - Rebuttal":"Yes, I was the one who filled the poison prop with poison. No one is scripted to drink it and it's labeled \"poison\"! But... knowing that the poison is real! And deadly! That makes your actors treat it with proper respect. Both Irina and Ego knew the poison was real. That was the point.",
        "Round 6 - Final statement":"While I may sometimes go to extremes to ensure that my shows slay theatrical conventions, and that I murder preconceived notions, I am not a killer.

One attends the opera for culture, for enlightenment, perhaps for a subtle nod to one's investments in the arts, not for such ghoulish spectacle!\n\nMy evening, you understand, was meticulously planned. A brief, vital conversation with the Producer, then to my box to witness my investment's second act. To discover the Producer, Mortimer Curtainfall, in such a state, at the foot of the grand staircase, no less, is a profound inconvenience. It reflects rather poorly on the establishment. One simply doesn't expire in such a public, untidy fashion. This isn't *Broadway*.

Could it be that Morty, with his relentless scrutiny of the opera's books, was on the verge of uncovering a significant, perhaps even family-scale embezzlement operation?

That was me, Ego. Sorry. \n\nMorty told me that I had been found out, but that he would deal with it somehow.\n\nWhy would I eliminate the one man who continually kept my most scandalous secret under wraps?
