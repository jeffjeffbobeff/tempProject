# Firebase Setup - Working Configuration

## âœ… Working Configuration as of [Current Date]

This document records the working Firebase configuration for TempProject.

## Dependencies Installed
```json
{
  "@react-native-firebase/app": "^23.2.0",
  "@react-native-firebase/firestore": "^23.2.0"
}
```

## iOS Configuration

### Podfile
- `use_frameworks! :linkage => :static`
- `$RNFirebaseAsStaticFramework = true`

### AppDelegate.mm
- Added `#import <Firebase.h>`
- Added `[FIRApp configure];` in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

### Files
- `ios/GoogleService-Info.plist` - Firebase iOS configuration
- `ios/TempProject/GoogleService-Info.plist` - Firebase iOS configuration

## Android Configuration

### Project-level build.gradle
- Added `classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.0")`

### App-level build.gradle
- Added `apply plugin: "com.google.gms.google-services"`

### Files
- `android/app/google-services.json` - Firebase Android configuration

## How to Restore This Configuration

### If you need to revert to this working state:

1. **Reset to this commit:**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard c34d9eb
   ```

2. **Or checkout the backup branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout firebase-working-base
   ```

3. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # iOS
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   
   # Run the app
   npx @react-native-community/cli run-ios
   ```

## Key Points
- Firebase is configured to use static frameworks on iOS
- All necessary configuration files are in place
- App successfully connects to Firebase on both platforms
- Metro bundler runs with `@react-native-community/cli`

## Troubleshooting
If Firebase stops working:
1. Check that all configuration files are present
2. Verify Podfile has the correct Firebase settings
3. Ensure AppDelegate.mm has Firebase initialization
4. Confirm Android build.gradle files have Google Services plugin
